# Tic-Tac-Toe Client with Authentication

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game client with user authorization implementation. There
will be user Authentication with sign-up, sign-in, sign-out and change password.
There will be a functioning gameboard with the ability to see game statistics.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- JQuery

## Development

I started off with implementing basic HTML for the foundation of the page
authentication processes. From there I moved onto creating the gameboard and
making it so that a user would be able to interact with it. Finally, I worked
on completing the game logic and determining the winner and whether the game
was a tie or not.

### Unsolved Problems

I have not been able to complete the styling for the application that I would
like. Getting the app to look more like the wireframes below is the long term
goal with some help from the youngins Elsa and Ana. 

## User Stories and Wireframes

- As a user, I want to be able to sign-up with an email and password.
- As a user, I want to be able to sign-in with an email and password.
- When signed in I want to be able to change my password.
- When signed in I want to be able to sign-out of the application.
- When signed in I want to be able to play the game.
- When signed in I want to be able to be able to see my previously played games.
