## Planning and Development

I started off with brekaing the project down into steps. I wanted to make sure
that I had a solid plan for how I wanted to write out the code for the whole
project. I made sure that all of the files that I thought I would need were in
plac and then I began coding. I worked on implementing basic HTML for the
foundation of the page authentication processes. From there I moved onto
creating the gameboard and making it so that a user would be able to interact
with it. Finally, I worked on completing the game logic and determining the
winner and whether the game was a tie or not.

When working on the problems that I had relating to different parts of the
project, I consulted with a few of my peers, console log, grunt nag and good
ole fashioned Google. I found that the processes of breaking down the problems
into the smallest pieces that I could provided the best method of success.


### Unsolved Problems

I have not been able to complete the styling for the application that I would
like. Getting the app to look more like the wireframes below is the long term
goal with some help from the youngins Elsa and Ana.


## User Stories and Wireframes

- As a user, I want to be able to sign-up with an email and password.
- As a user, I want to be able to sign-in with an email and password.
- When signed in I want to be able to change my password.
- When signed in I want to be able to sign-out of the application.
- When signed in I want to be able to play the game.
- When signed in I want to be able to be able to see my previously played games.
